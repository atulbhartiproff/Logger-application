I'll be uploading the progress here per day for personal use. This will help me understand my productivity rate as well.
Let's start this on 22 january,2024.

22nd January, 2024: 
I have decided to officially change the direction of project from application to website due to unavailablity of testing it on any hand held device.
I have created a basic skeleton of the home page. I am out of ideas for what the 4th option in my website should be. I will leave it at as Coming soon for now.
Added a news tab to the website. Might add only one for each category. Will look forward to it.
